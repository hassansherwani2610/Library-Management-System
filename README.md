# Library-Management-System

Structure:

The code defines an abstract class BookWormLibrary with methods for various library functionalities.
An ImplicationsOfBookWormLibraryFunctions class extends BookWormLibrary and implements the methods.

--> Methods:
  1. introDetails: Welcomes the user and prompts them to log in or view library information.
  2. outroDetails: Displays a closing message.
  3. historyOfThisLibrary: Reads and displays text from a file containing the library's history.
  4. logIn: Handles user login with account creation and verification.
  5. applyForMembership: Allows users to enter their information and apply for membership (writes to a file).
  6. listOfBooks: Displays books from a pre-defined array and a text file.
  7. add: Allows adding new books to specific genres (updates the array and writes to a file).
  8. receiptOfIssuance: Generates a receipt for issued books (doesn't implement functionality yet).
  9. issueBooks: Function seems to be missing, but it's likely meant for issuing books to members.
  10. borrowedBooks: Function seems to be missing, but it's likely meant to display borrowed books and due dates.
  11. displayBooks: Helper function to display books in a formatted way.
  12. addBookToGenre: Helper function to dynamically add a book to a genre in the array.

--> Improvements:
  1. Error Handling: Consider adding more robust error handling for file operations (reading/writing).
  2. Security: The current login system stores passwords in plain text. Consider using hashing for password storage.
  3. Database: Using a database instead of text files would be more scalable and efficient.
  4. Book Management: Implement functionalities for searching, editing, and removing books.
  5. Borrowing System: Implement functionalities for issuing books to members, tracking due dates, and returning books.

Overall, the code provides a starting point for a library management system. With further development and improvements, it can become a valuable tool for managing library resources.
